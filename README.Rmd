# A versioned database for leaf <sup>13</sup>C values from across the world

This is data associated with the following paper:

Cornwell, William K., et al. "Climate and soils together regulate photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination within C3 plants worldwide." Global Ecology and Biogeography 27.9 (2018): 1056-1067.

If you just want the up-to-date csv, just download from the releases tab or go to [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15233940)

Make sure to note the version number that you use. 

## How to use this package

**If you want to just download the data, all versions are [here](https://github.com/wcornwell/leaf13C/releases).**  Alternatively if you're an `R` user, the data is wrapped up in a handy little data packages.  See below for how to use it.  

**If you have a dataset that you'd like to add, please click on [issues](https://github.com/wcornwell/leaf13C/issues), and then `"New Issue"` and write a quick description preferably with a link to the paper/data.** We'll then sort out the easiest way to add those data.  

#### Install the required packages

```{r,message=FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/datastorr")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/leaf13C")
library(leaf13C)
```
That will install this library

```{r}
local_data <- leaf13C::get_data()
```
This should download the most recent version of the database on to your computer and load it into R.  

Meta-data for these columns are (here)[https://github.com/traitecoevo/leaf13C/blob/master/leaf13C_metadata.txt].

As the database moves forward the version number will change, but access to older versions will be possible through either this R package, the Github Releases page, or the Zenodo DOIs.
